Cross-platform embedded representation for algebraic data types, values, and common operations.

[![npm version and link.](https://badge.fury.io/js/uxadt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/uxadt)

This family of libraries supports a cross-platform embedded representation for algebraic data type (ADT) values, and platform-specific embedded programming abstractions for common operations (such as pattern matching) on algebraic data type values.
